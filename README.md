# Streaming User Segmentation

Will combine the following technologies:

**Snowplow Analytics** (utilizing Kinesis streams)

https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow


**Apache Spark** (for real-time stream processing)

http://spark.apache.org/



to perform User Segmentation on our event-level analytics and spread the results of that segmentation to external APIs.
